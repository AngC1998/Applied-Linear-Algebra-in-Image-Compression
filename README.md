The [Directed Readings Program](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/drp/about.html) pairs undergraduate and graduate students for a semester-long independent mathematical projects. This semester we studied certain concepts in Applied Linear Algebra like, and applied it to Image Compression. 

**Description of the Project**
- We implemented a Modified Gram-Schmidt Algorithm in MATLAB to convert to grayscale and compress by reducing the amount of bytes in an original image to a grayscale version while keeping close to the original quality of the original image. 
- We programmed in MATLAB for the project.
